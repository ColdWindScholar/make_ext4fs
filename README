This is yet another clone of make_ext4fs & friends, split from the
superr/make_ext4fs repository.

The reason for cloning was to fix a severe bug and to add a few features
needed by the [Android firmware construction kit project](https://github.com/anpaza/afck).

Also I needed identical builds for linux and windows. That was achieved
by modifying makefiles to support cross-building with mingw32.

The behaviour of make_ext4fs has been modified in the following ways:

 * In fs_config you can specify -1 in the place of uid, gid and mode.
   If the respective field is -1, the original value is retained
   (uid and gid have value 0 by default, and mode is taken from filesystem).

 * If a file is missing from fs_config, a warning is displayed but
   the uid, gid and mode are computed using the default rules
   (same like fs_config is not specified).

 * If during image creation it turns out that one of the source files
   cannot be open, the tool will:

        a) under Linux it will make an attempt to temporarily change
            file mode to 0444, then open it, then restore the original
            file mode.

        b) if that fails anyway, a error message will be printed to stderr,
            with a pointer to the file that cannot be read. Also a error
            flag will be returned that will tell the tool to delete the
            invalid image (and a message will be displayed about that too).
