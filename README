This is yet another clone of make_ext4fs & friends, split from the
superr/make_ext4fs repository.

The reason for cloning was to fix a severe bug and to add a few features
needed by the [Android firmware construction kit project](https://github.com/anpaza/afck).

Also I needed identical builds for linux and windows. That was achieved
by modifying makefiles to support cross-building with mingw32.
